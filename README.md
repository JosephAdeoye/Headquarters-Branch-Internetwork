# Headquarters-Branch Internetwork

A large enterprise has an HQ and a BRANCH. The HQ network provides wired and wireless access for employees. To improve network security, firewalls are deployed at the egress of the HQ and branch networks. To improve reliability, hot standby (HSB) is enabled at the HQ. To secure communication between the HQ and branch IPSec VPN needs to be configured.
