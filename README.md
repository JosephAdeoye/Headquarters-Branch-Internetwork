# Headquarters-Branch Internetwork

A large enterprise has an HQ and a BRANCH. The HQ network provides wired and wireless access for employees. To improve network security, firewalls are deployed at the egress of the HQ and branch networks. Hot standby (HSB) is enabled at the HQ to improve reliability. To secure communication between the HQ and branch IPSec VPN is configured.
